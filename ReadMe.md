## General Info
This project is a simple quiz! It showcases use of bootstrap, local storage, loops and if else statements. The user has 75 seconds to finish answering five questions. If the user answers wrong, their score gets subtracted by 5 points, if they answer correctly, they score 10 points. At the end of the quiz, users will add their initials with their score and it will be stored in local storage. 

## Roadblocks
I ran into several roadblocks with this code that went unsolved. The first being that the time wouldn't subtract with incorrect answers. The other being multiple Incorrects displaying when incorrect answers are clicked multiple times. Local storage was a challenge for me as well, but I overcame that hurdle!

## Technologies
Bootstrap version 4
