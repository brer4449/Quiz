## General Info

This project is a simple quiz! It showcases use of bootstrap, local storage, loops and if else statements. The user has 75 seconds to finish answering five questions. If the user answers wrong, their score is subtracted by 5 points, if they answer correctly, they score 10 points. At the end of the quiz, users will add their initials with their score and it will be stored in local storage and then posted to the high score leader board.
